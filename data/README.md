This is the de-facto directory for this final project, detailing what's inside each folder.

## Datasets

There are five mostly-raw datasets (.CSVs) here, as well as two modified ones heavily used. The codebooks for each of those (with a decent amount of overlap for the variables) can be found in the "codebooks" folder. Here are each of those datasets. In writing their descriptions, I worked off of the original dataset's description in Kaggle (that link can be found in the References section of the report).


### Raw Datasets, Names Changed

college_qbr.csv: ESPN college QB QBR metrics for every quarterback in college football since 2004. 

college_statistics.csv: NFL draft prospect counting statistics in college. Runs from 2014 to 2020. Includes counting statistics like interceptions, tackles, receiving touchdowns, and passing touchdowns by a player's college season. 

nfl_draft_prospects.csv: Information on NFL Draft prospects and draftees since 1997, including their names, selection numbers, their team name, as well as the grades and rankings that ESPN assigned to more recent prospects (since 2004).

nfl_draft_profiles.csv: More information for prospects since 1967, specifically ESPN grades and text analysis. 

nfl_draft.csv: Contains detailed information on every player selected in NFL Drafts from 1985 to 2015.Includes information on the players' names, positions, colleges, and draft round selections. It also contains information on the teams that selected each player and their overall performance in the NFL, particularly counting statistics and the metric approximate value (AV).


### Modified Datasets

nfl_draft_prospect_data_and_outcomes_1985_to_2015.csv: Joined dataset containing prospects from selected in NFL Drafts between 1985 and 2015. Contains both information contained in nfl_draft.csv -- players' names, draft round selections, and professional statistics -- as their well as physical attributes such as prospects' height and weight.

nfl_draft_prospects_and_profiles_combined_1985_to_2021.csv: Joined dataset containing prospects selected in NFL Drafts between 1985 and 2021. Contains information regarding their draft round selections, names, and positions. But most specifically, it contains physical data (height and weight) as well as ranking and grading data by ESPN for 21st-century prospects.

## Codebooks
A variable dictionary for each of the seven datasets mentioned above, each codebook aptly named for each dataset. All are .csv files.

## Project Memos
Contain files for both of my project memos:

Dowling_Ignacio_progress_memo_1.html -- My HTML file for Project Memo 1.
Dowling_Ignacio_progress_memo_1.qmd -- My QMD file for Project Memo 1.
Dowling_Ignacio_progress_memo_2.html -- My HTML file for Project Memo 2.
Dowling_Ignacio_progress_memo_1.html -- My QMD file for Project Memo 2.
